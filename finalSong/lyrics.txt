Susie Pup, By Naomi Perry
Lyrics:
Hey everyone, this is my song
I think it's gonna be about my dog
I'm not really sure what lyrics to use
So I guess I'll just have to tell the truth

Every day, I don't know what to do
Wake up in the morning and want to hang with you
I'm pretty sure that you want to hang with me
That's what makes you my favorite puppy

We can go on a walk, we can go to the beach
We can go to the park, you don't gotta wear a leash
We can run and play and have fun in the sand
And when we get worn out we can lay down and get tan
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog

SOLO

So anyway, that's my story
Got an awesome dog and I'm sharing the glory
Being away from home for 4 long years
Makes me sentimental, I might shed a tear

But 2 more weeks until we're reunited
I could not be more excited
Planning all the things that we will have to do
Making up for lost time created by school

We can go on a walk, we can go to the beach
We can go to the park, you don't gotta wear a leash
We can sit and play and have fun in the sand
And when we get worn out we can lay down and get tan
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog
You're my Susie, you're my dog
Yeah
